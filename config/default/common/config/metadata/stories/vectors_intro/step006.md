We can also add the population density 2010 layer to view the population density around the power plants. The population density layer is a raster layer, therefore it will only show the persons per square kilometer in the legend in the Layer List on the left hand side of the map. Lighter blues indicate lower population density, darker blues indicate higher population density. Note that we have changed the color palette of this layer, by clicking on the Settings icon in the Population Density, 2010 layer, so it is easier to view the red points of the Nuclear Power Plants layer.
