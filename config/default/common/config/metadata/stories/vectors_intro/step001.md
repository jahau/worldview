Worldview's newest feature allows you to interact with some vector feature layers and obtain more information about specific portions of the layers. Vector layers include points and polgons. The first three vector layers we have are Dams, Reservoirs, and Nuclear Power Plants provided by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC). Click on "+ Add Layers" in the Layer List and either type in "vectors" in the Search Box or click on the Featured Tab and select "Vectors".
